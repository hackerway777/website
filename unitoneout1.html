        1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that, <br>
        people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome
        them 
    </h3>
    <p class="unitytwo">
        This section describes several general groupings of disabilities, and how they affect access to the Web. There are no universally accepted or absolute categorizations of disability. Disability terminology varies from country to country, and between different disability communities in the same country. Abilities can vary from person to person, or over time, for different people with the same kind of disability. People can have combinations of different limitations, such as a visual and hearing disability together. This particular combination of disabilities is described below.
The term "disability" itself is also used very generally in this document. Many people with conditions described below would not consider themselves to have disabilities; they may, however, have limitations related to sensory, physical or cognitive functioning which can affect access to the Web. Limitations can include injury-related and aging-related conditions, and can be temporary ,or chronic. An example of an injury-related limitation that is temporary for some people and chronic for others repetitive stress syndrome. There is a trend in some communities away from using medical terminology to describe disability, and a trend in many communities away from using negative terminology or epithets frequently used in the past. This Draft Note does not attempt to comprehensively address these issues of terminology.

        1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites 
    </h3>
    <p class="unidadosrescuatro">
        the appropriate file types are ones such as HTML and CSS which are used to input the content and then the style and positioning of that content retrospectively, <br> languages such as JavaScript 
        or Python can be used for the Back-End to add more functionality to the website, <br> perhaps such as creating a gallery which continously scrolls through images on your landing pages

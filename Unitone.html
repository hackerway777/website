    <h2 class="preguntaunouno">1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
    <p>Information technology drives innovation and innovation is the path to business success. Innovation in business has the same impact that steam <br> had on the industrial revolution. 
        In fact, it’s hard to imagine any business that has not benefited from the digital revolution. <br> Even something as hands on as agriculture uses computers. Farmers use computers for production records, financial planning, <br> research on technical issues, and procurement.

    <h3 class="preguntaunodos"> 1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully <br> – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?
    </h3>
    <p class="repuestaunodos">
        Several digital project manager skills are acquired through basic work experience and collaboration. Skills such as time management, <br> resource management, project communication management, planning, organizing, and delegating can be developed in almost any role.<br>
Cloud-based project management and collaboration tools allow project managers to harness the full power of digital project management.<br> Serving as a single source of truth, they show you exactly where project status stands in real time.
These tools allow you to communicate with team members, <br> executive stakeholders, external collaborators, and more with real, up-to-the-minute data. <br> That means you can cut out status update meetings, saving your team time to do what they do best: execute.

            First of all we should know What is the aim of the website/eportfolio that we are going to create? <br>

<h3 class="preguntaunocuatro"> 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – <br> what causes digital projects
    to fail? Why?
</h3>
<p class="repuestadoscuatro">
    According to a 2017 report from the Project Management Institute (PMI), 14 percent of IT projects fail. However, that number only represents the total failures. <br> Of the projects that didn’t fail outright, 31 percent didn’t meet their goals, 43 percent exceeded their initial budgets, and 49 percent were late. <br>
An IT project might fail  because of these reasons 1. Inaccurate Requirements 2. Uninvolved project sponsors 3. Shifting Project Objectives 4. Inaccurate Estimates <br> 5. Unexpected Risk 6. Dependency delays 7. Not Enough Resources 8.Poor Project Management 9. Team Member Procrastination

<h3 class="preguntaunocinco"> 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software –
</br>how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? 
</h3>
<p class="repuestaunocinco">
    It can be easy to think of technology as a blanket solution to many of challenges facing your business. The thing about technology, however, <br> is that it comprises a wide variety of options and solutions and the key is finding the “right” solution for your needs. <br> In the last few years, there have been rapid advances in cloud services, artificial intelligence, data management, IT services, and more<br> that can make an impact on your business. But while some of the solutions may appear to be a great fit, ultimately, <br> they may not be the best option, depending on your specific needs. And also these are some great points to see while choosing the right technology: <br> The need for flexibility, categories of method, Comparing development Methods, Categories of Projects and more

        1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you
achieve your outcomes. – <br> How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub
help with your codes version control 
</h3>
<p class="repuestaunoseis">
    I Have used html and css to develop my website and they have helped me because HTML is very easy to learn and understand.<br> For the one who is learning web development, HTML is the first and foremost language that the person will go through. <br> It has simple tags and there is no hectic of case sensitivity in HTML. Almost all the browsers around the globe are supported by HTML.<br> 
HTML is very easy to edit as there is no need to have a special interface or platform to edit it. HTML is a user-friendly programming language. <br> One does not need to have any prior knowledge of any language. Understanding of simple English is sufficient to work with it.<br>
And CSS because separation of structure and style and many more
Trello helped me plan the kanban method and it let me know the progress of my project<br> and, github helped me solving code issues that i faced while making my website <br>

        1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does
GDPR impact digital projects? 
</h3>
<p class="repuestaunnosiete">
    There are significant legal constraints on the uploading and downloading of software and other digital content, including music and videos.<br> Many items are copyright and can incorporate digital rights management, such as restricting the number of times a media file can be copied or converted to another format. <br> When you buy software, you will  normally receive a licence to use it. You do not own the software itself, nor do you have the right to copy it. <br> Some types of licence, including freeware and shareware impose fewer restrictions.
    GDPR might also affect the image of your company <br>—for example, if you fail to implement appropriate security measures to protect the data you store and process, and suffer a data breach,<br> you might be obliged to communicate it not only to the relevant supervisory authority, but also to users affected by the breach. <br> A hit like that is not the best PR and may cost you more than you could possibly imagine—both in terms of user confidence and money. <br> Reference https://www.monterail.com/blog/introduction-to-gdpr-for-digital-companies

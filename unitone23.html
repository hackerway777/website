        2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making
        your own website, <br> are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code,
        Trello 
    </h3>
    <p class="repuestadosdos"> Visual Studio is very easy to use and it helped me so much while i was developing my website because is very fast and when you are coding <br> It will let you know if you miss any tags in HTML or even it will close the tags for you on its own when you open a tag. <br> And also visual studio has a great interface and one of the best features is that it can be used for a wide variety of technologies. <br> And also you can split as many windows as you want helping you to code easily while using css and html <br> and of course I love the color coding and automatic error checking.

        2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code,
        Trello 
    </h3>
    <p class="repuestadosdos">
        Yes both were appropiate visual studio because its easy and fast, before i used to use sublime text but when i tried visual studio <br> i sticked with it because i found it easier to use and also Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, <br> like IntelliSense code completion and debugging.
First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your way. <br> The delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your ideas<br>
and trello because it helped very much in the planning section. <br>

    2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with
    your website? Why? <br> Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests
    of openness. What would you change? 
</h3>
<p class="repuestadostres">
    The website i made is quiet easy and very simple and easy to use i think the strengths of my website is that is pretty easy to use <br> and it had all the content displayed briefly and easy to understand but i think it should have more  css than it has right now, <br>yes, i am happy with my website and i think the next time i make a website i will use more advanced tehnologies such as JavaScript

        2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project
    </h3>
    <p class="repuestadoscuatro"> 
        I Would like to make few improvements to my website such a having a better plan, plan every single part deeply so it wont consume me <br> much time other thing
        is that i would use the right imagery that works for my audience also i can create a navigation that, <br> guides users through my site because i think navigation is key and also
        its essentially the map that displays the core places users can visit <br> Because If users cannot find what they're looking for, they have no reason to stay on your site. Instead, <br>they will certainly bounce and find a competitor that offers a better user experience.

    <p class="repuestadoscinco">
        All the outcomes are fitting on their purpose well my website is pretty simple and pretty easy to use with very less css 
        and i think all the outcomes are well applied on the proper manner as it was described in the task given

        3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of
        productivity and efciency <br>– could you have been more efcient when making your
        website? How? Could you have done it in teams? 
    </h3>
    <p class="repuestados">
        The tools i used to make the website were really effective specially visual code which is very easy to use because VS Code includes enriched built-in support for Node.js development with JavaScript and TypeScript, <br> powered by the same underlying technologies that drive Visual Studio. VS Code also includes great tooling for web technologies such as <br> JSX/React, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Less, and JSON
        i would have been more efficient on my website by making it responsive and easy to navigate

    3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency 
</h3>
<p class="repuestatresdos">
    While working space is important to increasing productivity, it is also important to consider making adjustments to your work style and practices.<br> Below are some ways to achieve this: Manage time Given the nature of the career, web developers can become inundated with work projects and assignments. <br>It is important to organise the time spent on work as a way to minimise stress and maximise productivity.
    In order to stay productive and focused, <br> it is important to take time and rest your body and mind. Even taking 10-15 minutes is a good way to prevent burn out and encourage fresh ideas.<br> also managing task is very essential Due to the number or tasks and assignments that you may have as a web developer, <br> it is important to prioritise tasks based on their importance and to continue working despite any hiccups.

        3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects <br> – what
        would you do diferently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? 
    </h3>
    <p class="repustatrestrews">
        Bring teammates near and far closer together with communication software We all know that effective communication is crucial for team productivity. <br> Make every second count using time tracking tools If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it. To increase your performance and productivity, <br> you must first understand your work clock.
        Slack offers a huge number of handy features for team collaboration including group channels and direct messages

    <h3 class="preguntatrescuatro">
        3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions 
    </h3>
    <p class="repuestatrescuatro">
        As part of any digital transformation agenda, the ability the test and learn gives businesses the opportunity to experiment, <br>iterate and grow skills and competences throughout the organisation. For digital marketers, this opportunity is becoming increasingly important <br> as technology continues to advance and larger companies face new and emerging threats from more nimble, innovative competitors. <br>

To drive meaningful digital transformation at scale, businesses must therefore be open to the adoption of a test and learn culture,<br> which will enable marketers to optimise digital media activation, create first-class digital experiences and develop learning across the organisation.

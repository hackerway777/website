and freelancer <br> i am very passionate about coding and programming. i heard about code nation
when came to the UK in 2018 <br> and i saw all the benefits of studying in code nation and it made me 
came again in 2019 from the other side of the world <br> specifically for the develop coding course 
i had a very good experience in code nation because they focus more in practical coding <br> than theory and 
i believe that in just 3 weeks of the course i have learned more than the 3 years i spent in the university
